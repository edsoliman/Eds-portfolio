Whether it's a bold new application that's destined to be the next Google or a simple website re-design, I'm here to aid you in the process. I'm well versed in HTML5, CSS, JavaScript/jQuery...Outside of the Thinkful curriculum, I've been working on developing a fitness application with my roommate who's also a developer. As you may have guessed, I'm a big health & fitness enthusiast. When I'm not coding, you can probably find me at Gold's Gym Venice trying to become the next Arnold Schwarzenegger. I also enjoy reading, connecting with others and spreading positivity.</p>
